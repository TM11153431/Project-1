when clicking on a club or the map.

- [x] Parallel Coordinates fix
- [x] Placed logo's in the table

## Date: 26 June
Completely renewed the HTML framework of the site and created a wallpaper for the top side of the web page. Made a scrollable div for the data table and parallel coordinates to switch easily between those two while watching the map. Created the footer of the website.
Filtered some bad data points.

- [x] Redesigned HTML framework with W3
- [x] Created a scrollable div
- [x] Filtered bad data points


## Date: 23 June
Created a better update function for the parallel coordinates and did the presentation of my web application in the lecture.
Also made the table more interactive with a hover element and select element on clubs to instantly get the data for parallel coordinates.

- [x] Update function parallel coordinates
- [x] Table interactivity 
- [x] linked view table team click parallel coordinates

## Date: 22 June
Tweaked the table a bit so that all the data is on one page with scroll instead of multiple clickable pages. Created tooltips
for the parallel coordinates. Made the logo's in the map change the parallel coordinates data.

- [x] Table element scrolling possibility
- [x] Tooltips on the paths of parallel coordinates
- [x] Logo's clickable in respect to parallel coordinates

## Date: 21 June
Created the parallel coordinates element to get a better overview of the stats of the football players. Furthermore, the data of the club logo's needed to be reformatted to create a linked view with the parallel coordinates. Also I rewrote a couple of functions to make the web application smoother.

- [x] Parallel Coordindates element created
- [x] Club logo data reformatted
- [x] Rewrote functions


## Date: 20 June
Unable to work on the project because I was attending the symposium in Rotterdam

- [x] Getting inspired :)

## Date: 19 June
Merged table data with the geo map to create a linked view when you click on a specific club to see the player data in the table.
Tweaking the table on clickcing on a club because headers need to change for other details about the players

- [x] Created a python merge tool
- [x] Made linked view with map and table
- [x] Tweaked the table to convert column headers

## Date: 16 June
Cleaned up the website to show a smooth version of the visualization for the presentation.

- [x] Prepared presentation

## Date: 15 June
Switched to an alternative visualization from the bar chart to a scatter graph with zoomable function, because there are a lot of data points to represent all the players in the 4 competitions. Furthermore created another function for the interactive map to line up the club logo's when entering a zoom per country. Furthermore rewrote data to use for the scatter graph element to compare more variables.

- [x] Created scatter graph with zoom
- [x] Improved interactive map element
- [x] Data cleaning for scatter plot

## Date: 14 June
Subscribed to an API and retrieved all player statistics per team. Cleaned the data and prepared first elements for bar chart to visualize team comparisons and aftwerwards comparisons per country. Created python scripts to order relevant player statistics such as; goals, assists, minutes played, red and yellow cards.

- [x] Subscribed to data source
- [x] Python scripts to clean data
- [x] Creating bar chart elements

## Date: 13 June
Spend all day doing research for new API's to retrieve more team and player data to visualize in the third element. Afterwards did some work on cleaning the data.

- [x] Player and team data research
- [x] Cleaning data

## Date: 12 June
Finished all the properties of the table and made sure it is a linked view with the geo map. Searched for a good visualization for the third element containing pictures, graphs, and a text container.

- [x] Interactive table
- [x] Design research


## Date: 9 June
Preparing presentation for the lecture. Aftwards spend some hours on data research for player data to create the third div element.
Bug fixing some problems regarding the interactive map with the league logo's and club logo's. Searched for a better representation of the table.

- [x] Presentation
- [x] Data research
- [x] Map bug fix
- [x] Table element


## Date: 8 June
Retrieved data from http://footstats.co.uk about overall league standings and other league variables. Added league logo's when zooming in on each country. Bootstrap table added to state tables about the league and players. Tweaked the site layout in terms of positioning the elements.
Created the design document in GitHub.

- [x] League data retrieve
- [x] Added logo's to countries
- [x] Added table for extra content
- [x] Design document created

## Date: 7 June
Started to work on the interactive map element. Created a GeoJSON file containing the map shapes of United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Italy. Furthermore, I received an API key to get data and put it in a JSON file. .HTML, .JS files are created and the geo map is scaled with zoom in and out function on the page. Python file to merge several .JSON files is made to link club data to stadium coordinates to place on the map. Logo's are placed on the geo locations of the stadiums.

- [x] Data retrieved
- [x] JSON merger made in Python
- [x] HTML and JS made
- [x] Interactive map visualized
- [x] Club logo's placed


## Date: 6 June
Starting to brainstorm about an interesting linked view infographs containing information about the 4 major European football leagues.
The first element will be an interactive geo map where you can select a league and a club with zoom in and out. The second element will contain an hierarchic sideways menu with 3 levels; country, teams, players. In the last element all different data variables will be stated about the leagues, clubs and players such as logo's, team budgets comparison bar chart, historical player value and so on. I've searched for API's to retrieve the data from: http://football-data.org/index. 

- [x] Football linked view infographs
- [x] Data source
