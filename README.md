## Problem


## Purpose of the codes
This program is written in python 2.7.10.0 and is designed to cut rectangular shaped glass orders out of big glass plates.
This program contains 3 types of algorithms that try to cut the plates as efficient as possible:
1. Greedy place algorithm
2. Random place algorithm
3. Hill climber algorithm

## Libraries needed
Four libraries are needed to run these programs.
1. import numpy as np
2. from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
3. from random import *
4. from copy import deepcopy
