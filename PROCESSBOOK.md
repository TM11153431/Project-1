## Date: 7 June
Started to work on the interactive map element. Created a GeoJSON file containing the map shapes of United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Italy. Furthermore, I received an API key to get data and put it in a JSON file. .HTML, .JS files are created and the geo map is scaled with zoom in and out function on the page. Python file to merge several .JSON files is made to link club data to stadium coordinates to place on the map. Logo's are placed on the geo locations of the stadiums.

- [x] Data retrieved
- [x] JSON merger made in Python
- [x] HTML and JS made
- [x] Interactive map visualized
- [x] Club logo's placed


## Date: 6 June
Starting to brainstorm about an interesting linked view infographs containing information about the 4 major European football leagues.
The first element will be an interactive geo map where you can select a league and a club with zoom in and out. The second element will contain an hierarchic sideways menu with 3 levels; country, teams, players. In the last element all different data variables will be stated about the leagues, clubs and players such as logo's, team budgets comparison bar chart, historical player value and so on. I've searched for API's to retrieve the data from: http://football-data.org/index.
